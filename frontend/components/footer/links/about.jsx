        Hi there! My name is Stephen Chen. I am a software engineer currently
        working on my MS in Computer Science and Engineering at Santa Clara
        University. I would like to use this page to tell you about how this
        website came about.
      </p>
      <p className="about-the-developer">
        A little while back, I was packing some of my stuff to move.
        While putting away books from my bookshelf, I began to skim through
        some of the children's books, reminiscing about some of my favorite
        childhood books. At some point, I found my Goosebumps collection, one
        of which had "READER BEWARE... YOU CHOOSE THE SCARE!" on the cover. I
        remembered how much I enjoyed that book and how I could read it
        multiple times, and make different decisions that would lead to
        different events. I remember how some friends and I, after discovering
        that book, started creating our own "Choose Your Adventure" books. I
        remember mom got made at me because I wasted a LOT of printer paper.
      </p>
      <p className="about-the-developer">
        Anyways, I thought it would be cool if there was an app that allowed
        people to easily make these types of stories. Also, I wanted to teach
        myself how to use React and Redux, as well as brush up on my Rails
        skills.
      </p>
      <p className="about-the-developer">
        So I hope you enjoy the site! It's my first React/Redux project and it's
        still a work in progress. Thanks for visiting!
      </p>
